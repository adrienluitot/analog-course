About
=====

We are two students in microelectronics who work on a school project that involves design of an Analog circuit with open-source softwares. We wanted to elaborate a set of tutorials and documentation to simplify the usage of open-source CAD softwares.

What is this project?
---------------------
This course started with a engineering school project. The project was to create a practical class to design an analog
circuit, but by using only free and open source tools. We pushed this project a little further, we wanted to explain
every steps of analog design flow. From the PDK, to the silicon test, goign the specification, the design and the
verifications.

Analog design is something complex, and we hope this course will help to ease the additional complexity implied by
the free and open source tools.


How to follow the course?
-------------------------
The easiest way is to follow the titles on the left side bar from top to bottom. However you are free to follow the 
course in the way you prefer. Also, you are free to skip the part you think are useless for you. For instance, after
reading the introduction of one tool, you might choose to skip its installation because you won't need that tool.
