First steps
===========

Context & specifications
------------------------

To keep a simplified approach, we will design a single ended cascode RF low noise amplifier.
This will allow us to describe each step of the design flow and use most features of the softwares.

For this tutorial, we will desgin the LNA based on the following specifications :

Gv = 20 (26 dB)
IIP3 = -10 dBm
f0 = 2.45 GHz
Cl = 1 pF ; Qe = 2
Vdd = 3.3 V ; Idmax = 1.5 mA

..
  TODO
  How to formulate this ?
  Ll = 4.22 nH for Cl = 1pF
  gmM1 = 12.8 mS 
  Rl = 781.25 Ohms for Gv = 20
  Ci = 587.2 fF for Qe = 2
  //Ls = 2.5 nH ; Vod = Vdsat = 234 mV pour Id = 1.5 mA


Process variables
-----------------

The IHP PDK provides process control parameters for their components.
The parameters can be found on the file SG13G2_os_process_spec.pdf
in IHP-Open-PDK ▸ ihp-sg13g2 ▸ libs.doc ▸ doc.

Here, we retrieve NMOS parameters that will be useful for our design :

  TODO
  Add math integration here. Change format also

Lmin = 0.12um
Cox = epsilon/tox = 14.35 fF.um-2
tox = 2.45 nm & epsilonr = 3.97
Cjunc = 0.95 fF.um-2
